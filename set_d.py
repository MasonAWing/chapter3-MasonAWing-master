3.23 Write the `removeChar` function using *for* loops rather than slice
operators.
"""



"""
3.24 Modify the `removeChar` function so that it works for negative
character indexes.

"""
3.25 Modify the `substitutionCipher` function to use the `genKeyFromPass`
function.

"""
3.26* Encryption often involves the Caesar cipher - named after Julius
Casesar, who used the system to encrypt military messages. Many early
Internet users also adopted this cipher. Called `rot13`, the cipher
encrypts a message by rotating the plaintext character by 13
positions in the alphabet. For example, "a" becomes "n" and likewise
"n" becomes "a". The nice thing about `rot13` is that the same
function can be used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Write a
function called `rot13` that takes a message as a parameter and
rotates all the characters by 13 places.
"""


"""
3.27* Rewrite the Caesar cipher so that it takes the number of places to
rotate as a parameter. You will have to write separate encrypt and
decrypt functions.
"""



"""
3.28* Write a function `undoVig(keyLetter, ctLetter)` that takes a letter
from the key, a ciphertext letter, and returns the plaintext letter.
"""



"""
3.29* Writte a function `decryptVignere` that takes a keyword, the
ciphertext for the message, and returns the plaintext message.
